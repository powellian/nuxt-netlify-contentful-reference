# nuxt-netlify-contentful-reference
Reference version for a JAMStsck site - placeholder content throughout. Not currently hosted on Netlify but that's a quick TODO/WIP.

Includes mockup of environment variables and Nuxt configuration, with relevant links in comments.

Project runs locally as-per the following guide;  dependencies are up-to-date (as of writing this) - to test, run the following: `npm outdated -l`

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
